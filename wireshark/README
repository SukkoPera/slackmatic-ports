To restrict usage of Wireshark to a group of users, run the following commands:

# setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/dumpcap
# groupadd wireshark
# chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap
# chmod o-rx /usr/bin/dumpcap

Now add the user you want to be able to run Wireshark to the wireshark group

(setcap can be found in the libcap package)
